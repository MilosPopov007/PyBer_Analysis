# PyBer_Analysis
Exploratory data analytics for Pyber (Python-based ridesharing app company), using the  Pandas software library, Matplotlib (plotting library for the Python programming language) and interactive computational environment Jupyter Notebook
## Results
Importing data from  CSV files and writing Python scripts, main purpose of this analysis is to create a variety of charts that showcase the relationship between the type of city and the number of drivers and rides, as well as the percentage of total fares, rides, and drivers by type of city in order to help Pyber improve access to ridesharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.
After collecting the data (using the Pandas read_csv function and the OS module), next steps were, preparing and cleaning data for analysis, using summary statistics on the dat a as a whole and on individual columns, drilling down to specific rows, columns, and subsets of the data to make a comparison between the different city types.
* In order to make comparison of the selected data scatter plot was created  for each type of city.
-  [x] The x-axis is the number of rides for each city.
-  [x] The y-axis is the average fare for each city.
-  [x] The size of each marker is the average number of drivers in each city.
